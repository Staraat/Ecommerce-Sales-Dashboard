## Key Insights
- Sales reached $14.11 M (+5.04% vs YoY) while profit slipped to $1.30 M (-0.46% vs YoY). Volume is up (orders +15.02%), so margin compression is the main profit drag.
- LATAM (45.86%) and Europe (43.4%) together generate ~90 % of YTD sales. Pacific Asia contributes 8.3 %; Africa (2.3 %) and USCA (0.2 %) are niche.
- Green bars (Water Sports, Camping & Hiking) outperform PY margin, red bars (most other categories) underperform. This mix shift explains rising revenue vs. flat profit.
- Monthly ranking shows LATAM led Jan–May, but Europe takes the #1 spot from June onward, suggesting mid-year campaign shifts or seasonality. Africa and Pacific Asia gain share late in the year.
